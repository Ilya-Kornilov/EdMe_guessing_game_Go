# EdMe_guessing_game_Go

- A player is to guess the random number from 1 to 10
- There are five attempts
- Incorrect input does not lessen the number of attempts.
  It includes:
    * empty line
    * non numeric value
    * numbers less than 1
    * or numbers greater than 10
- The player wins if there is a correct guess whithin 5 attemps
- The game does not have a graphical user interface. It is a console one.
